                Hey there, Iâ€™m <span className='text-[rgb(6,182,212)] font-bold'>Ishpreet Nagi</span>, a software developer based in Canada.<br /><br />

                Apart from being the best programmer in my family (I am the only one), 
                I am currently completing my fourth and final year in computer science at 
                McMaster University.<br /><br />

                I am intrigued by all aspects of the software development landscape, reveling 
                in the frustration that accompanies the methodical process of backend development, 
                as well as the countless hours lost in frontend development. 
                Apart from those two, I spend my time learning and developing my skills within whichever 
                topic has caught my fascination. My recent interests include machine learning, game 
                development, and expanding upon my pre-existing frontend development knowledge with more 
                experience, like this website.<br /><br />

                Beyond my technical prowess and interests, you can find me enjoying a self-made latte with a 
                nice movie during a quiet night, getting lost in other worlds through a fun video game, or 
                simply jamming out to a track as I imagine myself in the music video.
